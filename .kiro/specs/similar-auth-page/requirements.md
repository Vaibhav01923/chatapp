# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a new authentication page that follows the same design patterns, styling, and functionality as the existing SignUpPage component. The new page will maintain visual consistency with the current glassmorphism design while providing similar form handling, validation, and user experience patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a new authentication page similar to the existing signup page, so that I can maintain design consistency across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new page is rendered THEN the system SHALL display a glassmorphism-styled container with backdrop blur effects
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show a centered form with the same visual styling as the signup page
3. WHEN the page is viewed THEN the system SHALL use the same color scheme (purple accents, dark background, white/gray text)
4. WHEN the form is displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper spacing and layout matching the signup page design

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with form fields that behave consistently with the signup page, so that I have a familiar user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with input fields THEN the system SHALL provide the same focus states and styling as the signup page
2. WHEN I type in form fields THEN the system SHALL update the form state using controlled components
3. WHEN form fields are focused THEN the system SHALL display purple ring focus indicators
4. WHEN I view input labels THEN the system SHALL show consistent typography and spacing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want form validation that works similarly to the signup page, so that I receive consistent feedback on my input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit the form with invalid data THEN the system SHALL display toast error messages
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission
3. WHEN I provide valid input THEN the system SHALL allow form processing to continue
4. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use the same validation patterns as the signup page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive elements that respond consistently with the existing signup page, so that the interface feels cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the submit button THEN the system SHALL show loading states during processing
2. WHEN the form is processing THEN the system SHALL disable the submit button to prevent double submission
3. WHEN I interact with buttons THEN the system SHALL provide hover and active state feedback
4. WHEN the page includes toggleable elements THEN the system SHALL handle state changes smoothly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new page to follow the same code structure and patterns as the signup page, so that the codebase remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component is created THEN the system SHALL use React functional components with hooks
2. WHEN state management is needed THEN the system SHALL use useState for local form state
3. WHEN the component handles events THEN the system SHALL follow the same event handling patterns
4. WHEN the component is structured THEN the system SHALL organize code sections similarly to the signup page
